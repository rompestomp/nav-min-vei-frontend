The font we use is Source® Sans 3

We have a total of 8 sizes in the design system. 14, 16, 18, 20, 24, 28, 32 and 40 pixels.

The basic size for text and digital products is **18px.**På WCAG-nivå A og AA

For best readability for all users, there should be no more than 50-75 characters per line including spaces.

At WCAG level A and AA, i.e. the levels we are required to meet, there is no requirement for a minimum text size or line height.

What the rules require is that the user can adjust the text size and line height.

If you use the typography components, you ensure that your fonts are coded in a way that allows the user to adjust them.

WCAG also requires good color contrast.

The typography components alone cannot stand for good contrast, since it is you as the designer or developer who controls the color choices.
